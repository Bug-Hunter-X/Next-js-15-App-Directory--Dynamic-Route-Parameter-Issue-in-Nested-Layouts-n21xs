# Next.js 15 App Directory: Dynamic Route Parameter Issue in Nested Layouts

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using dynamic routes and nested layouts.  The issue stems from accessing route parameters (`params.id`) that might be undefined in certain layout components.

## The Problem

When a layout component attempts to access route parameters that are not available (e.g., in a parent layout) during the initial render, it can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and silent errors.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/blog/[slug]/post`  You will observe a warning about missing route params.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for the existence of route parameters before using them in your components.  Optional chaining and nullish coalescing can help gracefully handle missing parameters.  The improved `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected implementation using `params?.id ?? 'default-value'` to provide a fallback value.
