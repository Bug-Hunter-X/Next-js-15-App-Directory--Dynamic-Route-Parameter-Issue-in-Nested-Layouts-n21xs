In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using the `app` directory's layout routing with dynamic routes and nested layouts.  If a layout component attempts to access route parameters (e.g., `params.id`) that aren't available in its parent layout, or if those parameters are undefined during the initial render, it can cause unexpected behavior, including silent errors or incorrect data rendering.  This is especially tricky to debug as it won't always throw a clear error message.
